~Data collection: I've collected data from my Spotify account for the year 2022. This data included information such as the artist, track name, genre, and number of times you listened to each song.

~Data cleaning: I've cleaned the data in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency. This included removing any duplicate data, fixing any errors, and formatting the data in a way that was easy to work with.


~Data analysis: I used SQL to add the genre of each song to the data. I also removed any duplicates and applied various coding techniques to answer a series of unique questions. These questions included:
-What are my top 10 most listened to artists?
-What are my top 10 most listened to songs?
-What are the most popular genres of music that I listen to?
-What are the most popular songs in each genre that I listen to?


 ~Data visualization: You used Tableau to create compelling visualizations of the data. These visualizations included bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs. The visualizations helped you to better understand the data and to identify trends in your listening habits.

Overall, this personal project was a great way for ME to practice my skills in Excel, SQL, and Tableau. It also helped me to learn more about my own listening habits. 
I realized that I spend a lot of time listening to music on Spotify, and I was able to determine what artists and genres I like the most.
