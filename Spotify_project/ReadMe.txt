
I conducted a comprehensive data analysis project utilizing data collected from my Spotify account of last year(2022).
I began by cleaning the data in Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency. I then utilized SQL to add the Track genre of each song,
removed duplicates, and applied various coding techniques to answer a series of unique questions.
Finally, I leveraged the data to create compelling visualizations using Tableau.
This personal project has helped me to practice my skills that I learned in EXCEL, SQL and TABLEAU
I realized I spend a lot of time listening to music on this platform and thanks to this project 
I was able to determine what artists and genre I like the most.
